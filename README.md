# Abstract
Over recent years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have dominated the area of recognizing images, achieving top results across many tests. However, the deterministic nature of CNNs limits their ability to depict doubt, which is crucial for numerous real situations. This work sets out to examine the aptitude of probabilistic models, especially Bayesian Neural Networks and Variational Autoencoders, for resolving duties involving recognizing visual content within images. Through complete experimentation, we demonstrate that BNNs offer a more stable and understandable structure by quantifying the uncertainty linked to predictions. Similarly, VAEs, with their power to generate, furnish a richer portrayal of image information, allowing enhanced extraction of features and recognition. By comparing these probabilistic models with traditional CNNs, we underline the advantages of including uncertainty and probabilistic reasoning in recognizing images. Our findings propose that BNNs and VAEs hold significant promise for advancing the field, offering both improved performance and deeper insights into the fundamental distributions of data.
